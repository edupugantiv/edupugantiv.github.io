  <p>Hi guys! My name is Vijay Edupuganti and I am a rising second year student from Portland, Oregon. I am currently studying computer science at the University of Virginia. <br><br> I am really excited to come to iXperience this summer as I've always had an interest in coding. I am very passionate about entrepreneurship and building new and innovative products and I think coming to iX this summer will help give me the tools to do so. <br><br>I'm very excited to explore Cape Town with all of you, whether it be through the planned excursions, hikes, or restaurants. <br><br> One fun fact about me: I'm a huge sports nut. I closely follow my Pacific Northwest teams (Blazers, Timbers, Seahawks) and my Hoos (UVa's sports teams).  </p>
